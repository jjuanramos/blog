2022 so far has âœ¨ kicked my ass âœ¨.

I started out the year by having surgery for appendicitis. Then, a close person to me got COVID so I got into quarantine for a week. And now, just when I was supposed to be able to socialize again, I am quarantined again because I got COVID myself. Beautiful.

Given my situation, a Saturday night seems as good as any to think out loud about what I would like to get from 2022, professionally speaking.

There is some stuff I'm interested in:
1. **Programming languages**. I have been following two new languages, [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) and [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/), and their ideas are incredibly cool. I would love to learn more about how compilers work to contribute to projects like those. 
2. **Databases**. I have been following Jamie Brandon's [Dida](https://github.com/jamii/dida) and it is super inspiring.
3. I currently work as an analytics engineer, and most popular solutions related to **real-time data** feel super complex and heavy (talking about you, Kafka). I would like to better understand why.

And above all, this year I would love to gain some basic knowledge of [CS fundamentals](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) - except I'm not reading most of these books (atleast for now ðŸ™ƒ).

Being self-taught is hard enough as it is, and putting myself in front of a huge theory book is just going to make me run away from learning anything at all. Instead, I took a series of books that implement stuff and will go along with those. My brain works better with the kind of philosophy the folks at [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) follow: Build whatever first and, once you do, peek under to see how it works.

So, for 2022 I would like to:
- Learn about Go by going over [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/).
- Read [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
- Read [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/).
- Finish [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).
- Create an ACID compliant database in Go.
- Explore an implementation of differential dataflow. _Maybe rewrite a simpler Dida in Go?_.
- Read [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/).
- Dive in what's going on in software I find cool (Such as [conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit), [Gazette](https://github.com/gazette/core), [Benthos](https://github.com/Jeffail/benthos) or [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)).

For the next 6 months I will focus on the first four points.
I'll see how it goes and recalibrate if necessary.

Hope to see you soon!

**P.S.** I'm focusing on Go-based books because Go seems like a small, simple language that will get out of the way pretty soon (and will allow me to focus on the things I care about).
