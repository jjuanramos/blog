2022 so far has ✨ kicked my ass ✨.

I started out the year by having surgery for appendicitis. Then, a close person to me got COVID so I got into quarantine for a week. And now, just when I was supposed to be able to socialize again, I am quarantined again because I got COVID myself. Beautiful.

Given my situation, a Saturday night seems as good as any to think out loud about what I would like to get from 2022, professionally speaking.

There is some stuff I'm interested in:
1. **Programming languages**. I have been following two new languages, Roc and Unison, and their ideas are incredibly cool. I would love to learn more about how compilers work to contribute to projects like those. 
2. **Databases**. I have been following Jamie Brandon's [Dida](https://github.com/jamii/dida) and it is super inspiring.
3. I currently work as an analytics engineer, and most popular solutions related to **real-time data** feel super complex (talking about you, Kafka). I would like to better understand why.

And above all, this year I would love to gain some basic knowledge of [CS fundamentals](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

So, for 2022 I would like to:
- Learn about Go by going over [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- Start and finish [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
- Start and finish [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/)
- Finish [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)
- Create an ACID compliant database in Go
- Explore an implementation of differential dataflow. _Maybe rewrite a simpler Dida in Go?_
- Still got to think about how I should learn more about data systems. Maybe implementing other toy system is too much and don't want to put too much in my plate. I will definitely try to understand how [conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit) works under the hood

For the next 6 months I will focus on the first three points.
We'll see how it goes!!
