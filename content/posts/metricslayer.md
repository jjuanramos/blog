(I admit it doesn't take too much to get me excited)

Would it be possible to build an infrastructure where dbt stores the core business logic?
Would it make sense?
What would that mean for data people? Would we still be data people?
Real Time + dbt Server opens the door for `purple people` to build
When is real time critical?

An advantage of something such as decodable is that it enables the data platform team to establish
how the data should be produced. If the data production is standardized accross a company,
and dbt Server works as an API, what could we do?

**THINK OF SPECIFIC BUSINESS CASES**

I have read a lot about real time this month. Main article was [this one](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying). Which combined with [this](https://tomtunguz.com/cloud-prem-architecture/) and [this](https://blog.getdbt.com/next-layer-of-the-modern-data-stack/) make my brain explode.

What would be needed to make possible to build all of your ERPs and CRMs around dbt + real time?
Is real time necessary? Does the fact that it's possible make it desirable? Would it be attractive for both start-ups and bigger companies?
Is the data mesh desirable?
