I will start this update by saying that my heart is with Ukraine. I canâ€™t say much more, I will just share [this article from Benn](https://benn.substack.com/p/nothing-to-add?utm_source=url) as I believe it captures perfectly the way I feel now. I hope Putin pays for what he is doing to so many innocent people.

This month I completed the first point from [my plan for the next six months](https://www.juanramos.me/starting-2022-with-a-plan/). I completed the [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) tutorial.

I also finished the first chapter from [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). I split my _learning time_ between that and reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).

I think this was a mistake, as I tried to complete the plan ASAP instead of focusing on fully understanding what I do. It has also led me to be kind of frustrated with myself as I haven't written a single line of code in the whole month, and I know that's how I learn best.

I have to remember that if I don't get joy out of this it's not going to be sustainable in the long run. For that, I need to shorten my feedback loops, and "just reading" it's not going to get me that.

Thus, I will stop reading DDIA for now and will fully focus on the interpreter book. But this time, I am also going to code. This month I finished the lexer section, so that's what I'm going to do next: write a lexer.

Achieving the plan would be great, but I'd rather just complete the interpreter book with a thorough understanding of how it works than do everything I set myself to do, without really comprehending what I went through. 

See you next month.
