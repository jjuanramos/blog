                    When I first started building in BigQuery the Data Warehouse for the startup I work at, I didn’t find any valuable resource about how to properly configure it.

                    I was looking for something similar to this amazing article from Jeremy Cohen about configuring Snowflake for dbt projects. I highly recommend that you read it before my post, it will give you a lot of context about what I’m trying to accomplish here.

                    To sum up, I really like the idea of setting up different warehouses (or databases) for different purposes. I also love this Role Based Access structure he proposes. It just feels right: you know beforehand what data users are going to be able to query, and you don’t mix raw and transformed data in the same database.

                    So, the purpose of this article is to explain how I tried to replicate that same structure that felt right into BQ
