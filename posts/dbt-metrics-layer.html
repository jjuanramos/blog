                    Drew Banin (dbt's CPO) raised
                    an <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/4071" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">issue on Github</a>
                    where he explains why it makes sense for dbt to be able to define metrics and shares 
                    what the first version of this could look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to expand further on what Drew wrote about or even on what the metrics layer is,
                    as the issue itself gives an amazing overview of that and points you to further resources
                    to understand it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe this is a super interesting move for dbt to take.
                </p>

                    As <a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/datas-horizontal-pivot" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">Benn wrote</a>,
                    the modern data stack has consisted on tools focusing on horizontal areas of the data process.
                    dbt has positioned itself in the transformation layer from the very beginning,
                    and it has been the stronger player on that area for a while now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, dbt is not <i>just</i> a transformation tool.
                    In fact, I believe the moment they released the documentation capabilities of dbt + dbt docs,
                    they implicitly recognized that themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    dbt has been used for a while by tools such as <a href="https://www.lightdash.com/" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">Lightdash</a>
                    as the foundation to build their product on. This makes sense, as dbt
