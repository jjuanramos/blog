                <p>
                    Drew Banin (dbt's CPO) recently raised
                    an <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/4071" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">issue on Github</a>
                    where he explains why it makes sense for dbt to be able to define metrics and shares 
                    what the first version of this could look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to expand further on what Drew wrote about or even on what the metrics layer is,
                    as the issue itself gives an amazing overview of that and points you to further resources
                    to understand it.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Rather, I'll give you my thoughts: this is a super interesting move for dbt to take.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    As <a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/datas-horizontal-pivot" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">Benn wrote</a>,
                    the modern data stack has consisted on tools focusing on horizontal areas of the data process.
                    dbt has positioned itself in the transformation layer from the very beginning,
                    and it has been the strongest player on that area for a while now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, dbt is not <i>just</i> a transformation tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First it was docs, then the “meta” field and then exposures, dbt artifacts and much more.
                    dbt has been working for a while on being much more than a tool to version control your SQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now dbt is explicitly stating its purpose of moving towards becoming <a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/the-data-os" target="_blank" class="page-link inline-link">the data OS</a>,
                    starting by moving vertically in the modern data stack and trying to set itself
                    as the owner of the metrics layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An open source company such as dbt with the ambition to own the entire business logic of a company excites me a lot,
                    primarily because of what it entails to analytics people: lots of tools are being built on top of dbt,
                    and I’m pretty sure that after this statement much more will be born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will we ever see a world where a data analyst owns the business logic that empowers the backend of a company,
                    be it through dbt or a dbt-based tool?
                    I, for one, can't wait to know.
                </p>
