                    I just finished publishing the new version of my blog.
                    Before its current look, it was using a Hugo template (todo: addlink) which
                    was pretty cool, but I believe it didn't look the way I wanted my website to
                    look like. So, what a better opportunity to practice my HTML/CSS skills than creating
                    my own website!

                    I think it's starting to look like I want it to look, but now that the rebuild is over
                    (for now), I have found myself into some new problems: it should have content.

                    So, I decided that a cool way to keep the momentum going was to share the most interesting
                    articles I have read in October so far. Hope you enjoy it!
